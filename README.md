# Superhero Universe 🦸‍♂️

A Python program demonstrating OOP concepts through a superhero class hierarchy. Features include class design, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Features
- **Superhero Class**: Base class with attributes (`name`, `power_level`, `secret_identity`) and methods.
- **Inheritance**: `FlyingHero` and `SpeedsterHero` extend `Superhero` with unique attributes and methods.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects sensitive data (e.g., `secret_identity`) with private attributes and getters.
- **Polymorphism**: Different `move()` behaviors (e.g., "Flying" ✈️ for `FlyingHero`, "Running" 🏃‍♂️ for `SpeedsterHero`).

## Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Save the code in `superhero.py`.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python superhero.py
